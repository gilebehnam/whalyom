> **Whalyom note (added on install; not part of the upstream agent).** Source: https://github.com/wshobson/agents (MIT). Inside Whalyom: read `product.json`, `profile.md`, `claims.md` and `LEARNINGS.md` first. Use only claims from `claims.md`; treat every statistic, benchmark or example in this skill as a general heuristic, never as a claim about the product. Write drafts to `outbox/` and results to `runs/<task-id>.json`; nothing is published, sent, or changes ad spend without owner approval, and budget caps in `product.json` always hold. No fake accounts, vote manipulation, bulk unsolicited DMs, or scraping against a site's terms. Code, API and CLI examples are reference only: do not install packages or run them against live accounts. This is an advisory agent: it returns findings and drafts, it never publishes.
